    "A data entry clerk is a member of staff employed to enter or update data into a computer system. Data is often entered into a computer from paper documents using a keyboard. The keyboards used can often have special keys and multiple colors to help in the task and speed up the work. Proper ergonomics at the workstation is a common topic considered. The Data Entry Clerk may also use a mouse, and a manually-fed scanner may be involved. Speed and accuracy, not necessarily in that order, are the key measures of the job; it is possible to do this job from home.",
    "Word processors evolved dramatically once they became software programs rather than dedicated machines. They can usefully be distinguished from text editors, the category of software they evolved from. Word processing added to the text editor the ability to control type style and size, to manage lines (word wrap), to format documents into pages, and to number pages. Functions now taken for granted were added incrementally, sometimes by purchase of independent providers of add-on programs. Spell checking, grammar checking and mail merge were some of the most popular add-ons for early word processors. Word processors are also capable of hyphenation, and the management and correct positioning of footnotes and endnotes. Later desktop publishing programs were specifically designed with elaborate pre-formatted layouts for publication, offering only limited options for changing the layout, while allowing users to import text that was written using a text editor or word processor, or type the text in themselves.",
    "Jim and Anne will be in charge of the spring field day to be held in early June. They will ask their friends' aid to get set up. There will be games for the boys and girls. The children will want to hike, ride their bikes, and swim. This yearly event will be held in the new Peach Grove Park. Ruth has work to do on the plans for food for the day. Last year Ruth spent most of her time helping the two cooks with many snacks. Hot dogs, fries, soft drinks, ice cream, and candy apples were big sellers. Apple pie and ice cream sold well too. I hope Ruth serves the same food this year. George Long will hire the band and singer for the day. A great jazz band will play. George's mom leads the group. The jazz band is sure to be one of the big hits. George is to have them play from one to four and also in the evening. The fine songs they will play are sure to please all of us. Nice gifts will be given to all of the winners in each of the events. Local news coverage will include television and newspapers. Joyce Scott will take care of the pictures for the school paper and yearbook. Maybe the national news will do a short story on the tenth annual spring field day.",
    "A freelancer or freelance worker, is a term commonly used for a person who is self-employed and is not necessarily committed to a particular employer long-term. Freelance workers are sometimes represented by a company or a temporary agency that resells freelance labor to clients; others work independently or use professional associations or websites to get work. While the term independent contractor would be used in a higher register of English to designate the tax and employment classes of this type of worker, the term freelancing is most common in culture and creative industries and this term specifically motions to participation therein. Fields, professions, and industries where freelancing is predominant include: music, writing, acting, computer programming, web design, graphic design, translating and illustrating, film and video production and other forms of piece work which some cultural theorists consider as central to the cognitive-cultural economy.",
    "The basic technique stands in contrast to hunt and peck typing in which the typist keeps his or her eyes on the source copy at all times. Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or keyboard (which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet flat on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.",
    "Now we have devised robots that are much more complicated than any other machines we have ever had. They are complicated enough to do jobs that until now only human beings could do, but that are too simple for the marvellous brains we all have. The robots, even though they are smarter than other machines, are still only capable of very simple tasks - the kind of tasks human beings ought not to waste their time doing. In that case, why not let the robots do it? Why shouldn't human beings do other and better things? After all, whenever there is an important new invention, some jobs are lost. When the automobile came into use, there was a gradual, but steady, loss of jobs that involved horses. There were fewer stables, fewer manufacturers of buggies and wagons, fewer whips, and fewer spurs. On the other hand, think of the jobs the automobile created.",

There were fewer stables, fewer manufacturers of buggies and wagons, fewer whips, and fewer spurs. On the other hand, think of the jobs the automobile created. Think of all the garages that came into being, all the auto mechanics needed, all the tyre manufacturing, highway building, oil well drilling. Automobiles created hundreds of times as many jobs as they destroyed. That's the way it will be with robots too.",
    "Lots of assembly-line jobs will vanish, but think of all the jobs needed to design robots, manufacture their parts, put them together, install them, and keep them in good repair, There will be many times as many jobs coming into being as are destroyed. The jobs that are destroyed will be very dull ones anyway, so dull that even a robot can do them. The jobs that will be created will be interesting ones that will stretch the mind. Of course, there is a catch. We can't just tell a person who has been working on an assembly line for twenty-five years to stop and take a job designing robots instead",
    "It takes a special kind of education to be able to work with robots, and assembly-line worker won't have it. If we are going to have a large changeover in types of jobs, there will have to be a careful programme of retraining and re-education for people with old-style jobs. It will have to be done even if they take rather simple new-style ones. That Will be expensive and hard, but it will have to be done. There are also sure to be people who are too old, or too beaten down by the dull job they had to do all their lives, to be able to take advantage of retraining. Some sort of jobs will have to be found that they can do. Eventually, of course, things will be different.",

    "The steaming cloths did nothing. After a while Sher Singh mother said, 'He must be carried to the hospital at Kalaghat. Then Sher Singh knew that his brother was dying. for all jungle people know that the hospital is the last resort of the doomed.I will run for my father, he cried. lt may be days before you find him. Sher Singh's father was known far and wide as Sher Singh Bahadur the Brave-a famous shikari, with the title Bahadur added to his name like a medal because of all he had done.",
    "He lived his life here in Laldwani village, grazing his animals, cultivating his bit of land. But whenever an expedition entered the jungle in search of big game, either to shoot or photograph them, they sent for this man, Bahadur the Brave. All along his skull and back and shoulder went a scar where claws had opened his flesh to the bone when he was pulling a comrade away from a tiger. Now he was away in the jungle with a photographic expedition. All the men of Laldwani village to0, as beaters. In this mud and grass hut, upon the floor of trodden earth, upon the low string charpoy, Kunwar lay crying sometimes, but mostly glazed and silent. Sher Singh looked at his young brother, and saw death in his eyes. There are no men in the village, he said. 'I will take him.",
    "His mother must stay behind to mind the cattle and work on the land without which they would all starve; and he and she both understood this without saying so. She took one of her two saris and made a sling for Sher Singh, and lifted up Kunwar, and put him into it. Sher Singh could feel immediately the heat of the boy's body burning through the cotton cloth on his back. He felt the weight too, and wondered how he was going to manage. He is too big for you, said his mother. She spoke in a whisper or despair. You will never get there. Sher Singh said nothing.",
    "Time is gold and time is money, if we utilıze it in a prop way and would not tolerate to waste even a single minute, because lost minutes add up to lost hours, lost hours add up to lost days, 1Ost days add up to lost years and lost years add up to fruitless life or a life in which so much remained undone. Many of us that are to say office clerks, administrators, doctors, teachers, engineers, law- yers, journalists and others are content to drift along, through the day, because they do not prepare a definite schedule of their activities. So, at the end of every day, they find that very little has been achieved."
